models for this kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only

both models are actually LSTMs. One is implemented with attention and does much better. i didn't do any cleaning or preprocessing due to the nature of the model. in the future i think using a transformer could drastically improve results
